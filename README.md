# Auth API (Mongoose)

## What is this?
An authentication API with JWTs using Express, TypeScript, and Zod.

This version uses MongoDB/Mongoose/TypeGoose for the database. I will also build the same app but using Postgres/Prisma.

## What did I learn?
The main point was to build a well structured boilerplate that I could base future projects on. I believe it was quite successful in that regard.

## What is missing?
The biggest issue is that there currently isn't a real mailserver - it's just using nodemailer to send the "emails" to the terminal. Other than that it's fully functional.
